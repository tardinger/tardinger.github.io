                Hello, my name is Theo Ardinger. I’m a Design major at the University of San Francisco passionate about blending creativity and technology. While my education has given me a strong foundation in visual design, I’m particularly drawn to motion graphics and web design, where I can bring ideas to life in dynamic, interactive ways. I am currently working as a design intern at USF’s in-house creative team at the Office of Marketing Communications!
            </p>
            <p>   
                I’m driven by the desire to create work that is not only visually effective but also meaningful and fulfilling. Whether it’s designing a responsive website, animating engaging content, or experimenting with new creative tools, I’m excited by projects that challenge me to think outside the box.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Outside of work, I find inspiration in the world around me—whether I’m exploring nature, completing puzzles, visiting museums, or watching a great movie. These experiences fuel my creativity and help me approach design from fresh perspectives.
